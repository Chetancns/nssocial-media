Social Media Application is a Web Technology based project which allows people to share ideas, share photos, like and comment on posts within the network. 
Social Media Application allows users to create profiles, share posts with friends. Users once registered can publicly post content. All the users following a profile can view and like the posts posted by the profile.
Social media refers to the means of interactions among people in which they create share, exchange and comment contents among themselves in virtual communities and networks. Social media or "social networking" has almost become part of our daily lives and being tossed around over the past few years. It is like any other media such as newspaper, radio and television but it is far more than just about sharing information and ideas. Social networking tools like Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and Blogs have facilitated creation and exchange of ideas so quickly and widely than the conventional media.
The frontend tools used were HTML, CSS, React JS. The backend tools used include MongoDB, Node JS and Express API. The project developed during the internship is “SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATION”. This website is hosted on Heroku Platform.
